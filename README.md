# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Built a Credit Card Fraud Detection Model ðŸ’³

I am thrilled to share a recent project where I developed models for credit card fraud detection, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Through meticulous analysis and innovative approaches, I was able to create highly effective models for detecting fraudulent activities:

âž–Data Understanding and Preparation:
Imported necessary libraries and thoroughly analyzed the dataset to understand its structure and components.

âž–Evaluating Security Measures:
Assessed the security of Chip and PIN transaction methods.
Analyzed patterns in repeat retailer fraud cases to identify commonalities.

âž–Correlation Analysis:
Investigated the relationship between various transaction attributes and fraudulent activities.

âž–Online Transaction Analysis:
Conducted in-depth analysis of fraud cases in online transactions to identify unique patterns and indicators.

âž–Feature Selection:
Utilized Random Forest for feature selection to identify the most significant variables influencing fraud.

âž–Model Building:
Developed multiple models to detect credit card fraud:
Random Forest Classifier ðŸŒ³
Logistic Regression ðŸ“ˆ
Support Vector Machine (SVM) ðŸ“Š

âž–Prediction:
Used the models to predict fraudulent transactions.

This project not only enhanced my data science skills but also provided valuable insights into the intricacies of credit card fraud detection.
